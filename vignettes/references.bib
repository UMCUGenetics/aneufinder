abstract = {Chromosome instability leads to aneuploidy, a state in which cells have abnormal numbers of chromosomes, and is found in two out of three cancers. In a chromosomal instable p53 deficient mouse model with accelerated lymphomagenesis, we previously observed whole chromosome copy number changes affecting all lymphoma cells. This suggests that chromosome instability is somehow suppressed in the aneuploid lymphomas or that selection for frequently lost/gained chromosomes out-competes the CIN-imposed mis-segregation. To distinguish between these explanations and to examine karyotype dynamics in chromosome instable lymphoma, we use a newly developed single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) platform that provides a complete and unbiased overview of copy number variations (CNV) in individual cells. To analyse these scWGS data, we develop AneuFinder, which allows annotation of copy number changes in a fully automated fashion and quantification of CNV heterogeneity between cells. Single-cell sequencing and AneuFinder analysis reveals high levels of copy number heterogeneity in chromosome instability-driven murine T-cell lymphoma samples, indicating ongoing chromosome instability. Application of this technology to human B cell leukaemias reveals different levels of karyotype heterogeneity in these cancers. Our data show that even though aneuploid tumours select for particular and recurring chromosome combinations, single-cell analysis using AneuFinder reveals copy number heterogeneity. This suggests ongoing chromosome instability that other platforms fail to detect. As chromosome instability might drive tumour evolution, karyotype analysis using single-cell sequencing technology could become an essential tool for cancer treatment stratification.},

title = "Hidden Markov models for the analysis of next-generation-sequencing data",
abstract = "Modern day biology increasingly relies on the production and analysis of huge amounts of digital data. This data is produced by new experimental techniques which allow ever deeper insights into the mechanisms by which our cells function. One such technique is “Next Generation Sequencing”. It was developed in the 2000s and is now widely applied to the study of all phenomena which involve the DNA sequence. The presented thesis describes novel algorithms for the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. More specifically, four different algorithms are presented. These algorithms were developed for different varieties of NGS experiments, each of which allows a unique perspective into the cell.Chapter 1 gives an introduction to Next Generation Sequencing and explains in more detail how the same technology can be used in a modified form to investigate different types of sequence related phenomena. Chapter 2 presents a model for the analysis of copy number gains and losses in single cells from NGS data, and this method has been applied to investigate the role of aneuploidy in Alzheimer’s disease, as well as the role of smaller copy number aberrations in cancer cells. In Chapter 3 an extension of the model from Chapter 2 is presented.Chapter 4 and 5 present models for the analysis of epigenetic modifications on the DNA, and these models can help to increase our knowledge of how totipotent stem cells differentiate into specialized cell types, and how the environment can affect gene expression.",
